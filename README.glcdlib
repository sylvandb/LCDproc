The so-called "meta-driver" glcdlib extends LCDproc's supported drivers by
all the drivers supported by graphlcd-base, which you can get from
http://graphlcd.berlios.de.
In order to be able to use it, you have to get and install the glcdprocdriver
from http://www.muresan.de/graphlcd/lcdproc before configuring the LCDproc
build process --enable-drivers=glcdlib.
