LCDd lirc driver README - Harald Klein, linux@chello.at
*******************************************************

This is the first release of lirc driver for LCDd.
To use it simply enable it with configure

eg. (Matrix Orbital Display and lirc):
$ ./configure --enable-drivers=mtxorb,lircin

This driver parses the .lircrc file. remote and mode are
also supported. You can define a LCDd key with 

- --- snip .lircrc ---
begin
        prog = lcdd
        button = 2
        config = A
end

begin
        prog = lcdd
        button = 4
        config = B
end

begin
        prog = lcdd
        button = 6
        config = C
end

begin
        prog = lcdd
        button = 8
        config = D
end
- --- snip ---


Any suggestions? Feel free to write a mail...

Have fun!

PS.: 
You don't have an infrared receiver? 

1.) visit the Lirc homepage and get lirc. http://fsinfo.cs.uni-sb.de/~columbus/lirc/
2.) decide for device (irman, animax, home brew receiver, universal remote ...)
    If you want to build the serial receiver i suggest to ask Infineon for test samples 
    (sfh5110-36, eg, be sure to get correct freq, i use 36 khz, fits for all my remotes)
    and USE THE 7805 TO REGULATE THE VOLTAGE !! its cheap, and the circuits with transistors
    mostly wont work.
3.) Install lirc 

PPS.: Yes, this also works with IRMAN.

Greets to all open source developers out there!!!
