INTRODUCTION

LCDproc is a small program that extracts various statistics about your
machine and displays them on an LCD display.  It works with several types
and sizes of displays.

Our site is located at http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net/ ... so check
there first for new versions or updates.  We've got a spot on the web
site for user's suggestions, and you can e-mail us as well:

choadster@earthlink.net (William W. Ferrell)
scriven@cs.colostate.edu (Scott Scriven)

INSTALLATION

Refer to the INSTALL file included with this archive for installation
instructions (including how to connect the LCD to your system).

Also, be sure to EDIT THE Makefile.config before compiling.  It
contains many configuration options.  (these will be removed as soon
as LCDproc uses a real config file)

CHANGES

Woow...  a lot.  :)

HELPING OUT

If you get the urge to help out by writing code, feel free to "make todo"
and find out what needs to be done...  (also, of course, new ideas are
good too :) 

To add new drivers, read drv_base.h for instructions.
