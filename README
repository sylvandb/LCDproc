-- INTRODUCTION --------------------------------------------------------

LCDproc is a small program that extracts various statistics about your
machine and displays them on an LCD display.  It works with several types
and sizes of displays.

Our site is located at http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net/ So check
there first for new versions or updates.  We've got a spot on the web
site for user's suggestions, and you can e-mail us as well:
