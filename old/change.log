  all:      Implemented logical/physical drivers..  Whew!
	    main.c, mode.c, lcd.* have changed, and I've added text.* and
	    MtxOrb.* driver files...
	    New commandline option "-l driver" selects a driver.

  all:      Lots of updates...  (patches, etc)
            Implemented a frame buffer, and custom characters...
	    Added lots of comments, and cleaned a few things...
	    Added a few function to lcd.c
	
1998-03-22: Scott
  main.c:   Should exit cleanly now, always...  It sometimes wouldn't, if killed
  	    by init at shutdown...  (it would get stuck in a usleep for too
  	    long, and then get killed instead of shutting down)
  main.c:   Changed timing method...  Sequences now specify their length in 
  	    TIME_UNITs.  A time unit is 1/8th of a second.  This should make
  	    blinking and other such things easy...
  main.c:   Removed command line options to specify timings...  Why would the
  	    user really need to change that anyway?
  main.c:   A few mode-feedback things are implemented: blinking, and backlight
            on/off stuff...
  mode.c:   Xload_screen now sends feedback to toggle blinking for a high load,
            or turn the backlight off for no load...

  Makefile: Installs man page in /usr/local/man/man1...
  main.c:   Now detects previously running lcdproc.
  lock.?:   New files for detecting another lcdproc...
  	Now detects an already-running process, and gets its pid.  So far,
  	it just exits when this happens.

  Makefile: Now handles installation with "make install".
  main.c: New command line stuff... (in man page)  Also, default contrast is
          140 now.  Looks better from all angles, at least on my machine. :)
  lcd.1:  Man page.  New..  :)
  mode.c: Rearranged memory screen..  Shows Memory and Swap space separately,
  	  with two graphs.

  mode.c: Rearranged memory screen.  Worked around hbar bios bug.  Added swap
          info to this screen also, so get_mem_info is back to its former
          state.  (call it on an array)
  mode.c: Fixed xload screen.  It was displaying things one space to the left.
  main.c: Changed command line style from "mode num_times delay_time" to
          "mode total_time delay_time".  Is this better or worse?

1998-02-22: Scott
  main.c: Now handles SIGINT (Ctrl-C) and SIGTERM (kill) for a clean exit.
  main.c: Default device now works.  (device[] was getting overwritten by
          argv[0], which would always be "lcd")
  mode.c: Fixed CPU load meter.  Decreased cpu buffer size back to 4.
  mode.c: Made goodbye_screen() do something...
  mode.c: Fixed am/pm on clock_screen().  Was previously displaying 12:xx:xxA
          during the noon hour, instead of 12:xx:xxP.

1998-02-18: Scott
  mode.c: Fixed crash on memory screen; commented out last two lines of
    get_mem_info, which accessed a non-existent variable.
  mode.c: Added "rep" parameter to all screen functions.  Specifies how many times
    that screen has been run.  Using 0 will force screen clear/redraw, and
    the time-based ones also use this to determine if colons should be drawn.
  main.c: Implemented simple command-line parameters.  Example:
    lcd m 4 .5 /dev/cua1 x 1 2
    uses /dev/cua1 for lcd, displaying memory info 4 times at .5 seconds each,
    and the xload screen once for 2 seconds; then loops.
  mode.c & lcd.c: created "NOLCD" preprocessor switch.  When defined, lcd uses
    text output (stdout) instead of the com port.
  mode.c: Changed clock string generation to use "%02d" to achieve that
    "02:37:06" look.  (hint: printf can pad numbers with leading 0's)
  main.c: Added minimal command-line help.
