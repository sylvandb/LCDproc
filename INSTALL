0. REALLY-QUICK START

If you're in a desperate hurry:

./configure
make
su
make install

1. GETTING STARTED

First read the README if you haven't already.

2. CONNECTING THE DISPLAY TO YOUR SYSTEM

For now, please refer to LCDproc's hardware page at
http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net/hardware.php3 for details. Several
different types of displays are now supported.

3. BUILDING LCDPROC

As long as you have a working automake, gcc and make, this should work.

 - Run the autogen.sh script to create ./configure
        sh autogen.sh
 - Run the configure script:
        ./configure
 - Run make to build the server and all clients
        make

LCDproc will build in (hopefully) a few seconds. It's not very big. If
you want, you can install it (if you're root) by typing:

make install

This will install the binaries and the man page, and will make a link
called /dev/lcd which points to whatever port you specified in the
Makefile. It will also change the permissions on the specified port
to allow all users to write to the port (so users can run LCDproc).
If you _don't_ want to allow this, change the permissions back after
installing LCDproc. :)

[change this stuff]

4. RUNNING LCDPROC / MANUAL INSTALL

First, you'll need to run the LCDd server.  If you're in the LCDproc
source directory, and have just built it, run...

       server/LCDd -d joy -d MtxOrb

This assumes you want to use the Matrix Orbital LCD driver and a
joystick.  You can find out what other drivers are available by
running "LCDd -h".  Note that you can use more than one driver at the
same time.

Then, you'll need some clients.  LCDproc comes with one:

       clients/lcdproc/lcdproc C M T X &

This will run the main LCDproc client, with the [C]pu, [M]emory,
[T]ime, and [X]load screens.  The ampersand (&) puts it in the background.

To install manually, you'll want to do something like the following:

	su
	cp server/LCDd /usr/local/bin
	cp clients/lcdproc/lcdproc /usr/local/bin
	cp docs/lcdproc.1.gz /usr/local/man/cat1
	ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/lcd

Some prereleases or development releases will have broken auto-install
scripts, so manual installs may be necessary for those versions.

[this needs to be updated as well]

5. PUTTING LCDPROC IN SYSTEM STARTUP

It's nice to have LCDproc start when the computer boots, so here's how
to do it:

In Slackware or RedHat:
	Add lines to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local, such as the following:
	  echo "Starting LCDproc..."
	  /usr/local/bin/lcdproc C M X &

In Debian:
      - Make a file "/etc/init.d/lcd" which works the same as the
	other scripts in that directory.  (it should accept "start"
	and "stop" as parameters...)
      - To start, run "LCDd" with any necessary parameters.  It will
	put itself in the background as a daemon.
      - Also in the "start" section, add "lcdproc" with some
	parameters.  Be sure to put a "&" on the end, or the system
	will get stuck there when you boot.
      - And, put in any other clients you want to run all the time.
      - For the "stop" section, simply "kill" all the programs you
	started in the "start" section.  They will shut down and exit.
	I recommend killing the server after all the clients, but it
	really doesn't matter much.

      - Now, add symlinks from /etc/rc[2-5].d/S50lcd to /etc/init.d/lcd,
        and be sure to get /etc/rc[06].d/K50lcd to /etc/init.d/lcd.
	This will cause LCDproc to shut down when your system does.

That's all the OS`s we've actually done this with so far..
