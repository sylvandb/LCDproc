SYNOPSIS

        lcdproc - displays system status on Matrix-Orbital 20x4 LCD
        on a serial port

USAGE

        lcdproc [-d device] [-c contrast] [modelist]

DESCRIPTION

        lcdproc uses a 20x4 character LCD manufactured by Matrix-Orbital
        to display status information about the system.

        Currently, only Linux is supported (kernels 2.0 and greater), and
        /proc filesystem support is required. In addition, only displays
        made by Matrix-Orbital are supported at this time (their displays
        have built-in controllers and a very good BIOS).

        lcdproc understands these options:

        -l driver
        	The lcd display driver to use.  So far, this can only be:
			text	Text-mode output.		(20x4)
			MtxOrb	Matrix Orbital displays...	(20x4)
			curses	Curses-based terminal output	(20x4)
			debug	Verbose debugging text output	(terminal)

        -d device
        	The serial port attached to the display. Usually /dev/cua0
                or /dev/cua1. This device is locked by lcdproc.

        -c contrast
        	Sets the display's contrast setting to the value specified,
                ranging from 0 to 255. Note that values below around 30
                yield invisible characters from most viewing angles, and
                values above 200 yield solid cells from most viewing
                angles.

        modelist
                A list specifying what screens to display, and in what order;
                in the form:

		mode [mode mode mode ...]

		where mode is one of...
			"C" (CPU usage), 
			"G" (CPU Graph like Xload),
			"M" (Memory Usage),
			"X" (X-Load),  
			"T" (Date, time, Uptime, OS version)
			"D" (Disk Stats),
			"B" (Battery Stats),
			"A" (About),
			"O" (old date and time screen), (removed soon?)
			"U" (System Uptime), (will be removed soon?)

	For example:

		lcdproc -d /dev/cua1 -c 180 C M D X -l MtxOrb

		selects /dev/cua1 (com2) as the serial port for the
		MtxOrb driver, sets the display's contrast to 180, 
		and specifies the following modes:

		- CPU Usage, updated every 1/8th of a second for 4 seconds.
		- Memory usage, updated every 1/4th of a second for 4 seconds.
		- Uptime, updated every 1/2 second for 4 seconds.
		- Date and Time, updated every 1/2 second for 4 seconds.
		- X-Load average over time, updated once per mode cycle.


CAVEATS

The command line will change a lot Real Soon Now(tm).  Be sure to
check on this when installing new versions.

The "idle" stat on the time screen (D) reflects how much idle time
your system has had since booting.  So, if you leave the machine
running at night without doing anything, you'll have at least 50%
idle.  :)

KNOWN BUGS

	- Only supports 20x4 displays, so far.
	- Doesn't lock the com port... yet.
	- Doesn't always shut down correctly when killed by init. (?)
	  (during "shutdown -h now", for example)

LEGAL STUFF

	LCDproc is released as "WorksForMe-Ware".  In other words, it is free,
	kinda neat, and we don't guarantee that it will do anything in
	particular on any machine except the ones it was developed on.
	
	It is technically released under the GNU GPL license (you should
	have received the file, "COPYING", with LCDproc) (also, look on
	http://www.fsf.org/ for more information), so you can distribute and
	use it for free -- but you must make the source code freely available
	to anyone who wants it.

	For any sort of real legal information, read the GNU GPL (GNU General
	Public License).  It's worth reading.
