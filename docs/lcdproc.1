.SH LEGAL STUFF
LCDproc is released as "WorksForMe-Ware".  In other words, it is free, kinda neat, and we don't guarantee that it will do anything in particular on any machine except the ones it was developed on.
.PP
It is technically released under the GNU GPL license (you should have received the file, "COPYING", with LCDproc) (also, look on http://www.fsf.org/ for more information), so you can distribute and use it for free -- but you must make the source code freely available to anyone who wants it.
.PP
For any sort of real legal information, read the GNU GPL (GNU General Public License).  It's worth reading.
