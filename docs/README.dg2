Hello,

In order to compile LCDd (the lcdproc server) with support for IRman,
you need to put libirman in a neighbor directory.
Currently I use version 0.4.1b and this is hard coded into makefile and
#include string. (could do better).

Now for libirman to "work" you need a .irmanrc file with description of
you infrared "code" and mapping to command in my driver.
A template of such a file is given in the driver directory. This template
will only work with my JVC remote control, but you already have configured
IRman, you should be able to modify it for yours.

FINDING THE COMPONENT:

lcdproc: deamon to display information on a lcd screen.
	version: 0.4-pre5
	need libirman and my driver to support input from IrMan.

libirman: library in use to read input from IrMan on a serial port.
	version used: 0.4.1b
	currently used untouch and just needed to use my driver for lcdproc.

-----------Here stop the currently usefull information------------

The following text describe a project I never finished: LCDCD.
If anybody wish to do such an LCDd client, have a look at cdtools.

David GLAUDE

lirc: standardize interface to control IR receaver and emetteur.
	version: 0.5.4
	currently not used but might be usefull have support for other IR.

cdtools: command line program to control the cdrom and play audio cd.
	might need some patch to have a better output of cd song information.

Hello,

This file describe the personnal developpement I have made and wich sources
you need to bring together in order to integrate everything the same way
I did.

Basicaly, we are talking about a yet another CD player 'yaCDplayer' but
because the name might already have been in use, it was decided to call it
'lcdcd'.

This CD player take as input (control) and output (display of the status) the
lcdproc server. It as thus no user interface on it's own.
Lcdproc is a server that allow the control of LCD screen over TCP connection.
Some LCD screen also have support to connect a keypad, it also offer
input user interface for this program.
Because lcdproc is a very flexible input/output server, it also support for
input comming from a joystic, the keyboard (curses output) or even irman.
It also support multiple driver simultaniously and multiple driver like curses
and joystic for those without an LCD screen and an irman.

Now irman is an infrared receaver with a build in chip to hash the input
signal into a unique key that can be readed throught a serial interface.

An other important think about lcdcd it is that in order to communicate with
lcdproc we use a TCP/IP connection. Lcdproc need to run in background on the
server where the input/output device are connected. Lcdcd must run on the
client where the cdrom is located. In between, we need to have a TCP/IP
network. Now, if you have a firewall, you will let traffic from the client to
the server on port 13666 wich is the default for lcdproc, be carefull there
is not security build in lcdproc and anybody can connect to it. If you don't
have an IP network and the client and the server are located on a single
computer (with the CDROM, the LCD screen and the IrMan connected) then you
need to enable IP on this computer. This can be done by putting an IP address
on a loopback interface (like 127.0.0.1 on lo, try 'ifup lo' it might work
also on your distribution of Linux).

Currently, this ... ---to be continued---
