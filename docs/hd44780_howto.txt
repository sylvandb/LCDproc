The code in LCDproc for the hd4470 LCD controller chips comes from
"lcdtext" (by Matthias Prinke) or one of the derivatives ("lcdstat4",
"lcdtime").

You might like to get those packages down as well and have a play.

LCDproc-0.4 only supports 4 line displays, but LCDproc-0.3.5 runs 2 line
displays also.  A different maintainer is responsible for this version.

The pinouts are like so : (From lcdtext)

1.1 Connecting the LCD to a printer port
-----------------------------------------

    LCD                  printer port
Pin     signal          Pin     signal

1       GND             18..25  GND
2       +5V             --- *)
3       Vadj.           --- *)
4       RS              6       D4
5       RW              7       D5
6       EN              8       D6
11      D4              2       D0
12      D5              3       D1
13      D6              4       D2
14      D7              5       D3      

Getting the supply voltage: 
   Use a floppy supply connector, get it from the game port, take some
diodes and a capacitor and get it from the port's data lines, get it
from the keyboard connector or whatever you like. Be save to avoid
short circuit. You need only 3mA at 5V! (if you have the same type
lcd)

Connecting the contrast adjusting pin (Vadj.):
     
     (variable resistor)   
        .------.        
 Vcc ---|  10k |--- GND
        `---^--'
           /|\
            |
          Vadj.
