Hey, thanks for reading this first! :)

*** NOTICE ****************************************************
This is a development version of LCDproc, straight from the CVS
repository.

THIS VERSION OF LCDproc IS *NOT* GUARANTEED TO RUN, OR EVEN
COMPILE! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!
***************************************************************

With that out of the way, welcome to the bleeding edge of LCDproc.
To build and run this version, you'll need autoconf 2.50 or higher
and friends installed.

Run:

$ chmod +x ./autogen.sh
$ ./autogen.sh

This produces the configure script and supporting files, and also
runs configure with defaults. You want to run configure again with
your own options, trust me :) I suspect the default drivers it sets
aren't going to match your setup.

Once the above two commands have run, the rest is pretty standard:

$ ./configure --help
[read about the options, figure out what to use]
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-drivers=ncurses,cfontz
[replace ncurses,cfontz with comma-separated list of drivers you want]
$ make
$ su
$ make install
[make install is OPTIONAL ... might not want to replace a stable
version of LCDproc with a development release]

Patches and suggestions are welcome! Join the mailing list to get
started. See http://lcdproc.org/ for more information.
