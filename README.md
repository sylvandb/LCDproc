The [LCDproc project](https://github.com/lcdproc/lcdproc) is now officially on
GitHub!

With the full history here and there, you should be able to fairly easily
import your patches onto the [official repo](https://github.com/lcdproc/lcdproc)
and submit pull requests there. If for some reason this seems too much and my
repo seems possible, then go ahead and send me your pull request.

Unfortunately it is not possible to switch your clone to or rebase patches from
this repo to the [official repo](https://github.com/lcdproc/lcdproc) due to
differences in the way the commit history was imported. For example the offical
history has e-mail addresses! This means the commit hashes are not the same
here and in the [official repo](https://github.com/lcdproc/lcdproc) so as far
as git is concerned they are not the same history.

Please use the official repo from now on.

So long, and thanks for all the fish.
