# LCDd.conf
#
# This file contains the configuration for the LCDd server.
# 
# The format is ini-file-like. It is divided into sections that start at
# markers that look like [section]. Comments are all line-based comments,
# and are lines that start with '#' or ';'.
#
# The server has a 'central' section named [server]. Further each driver 
# has a section which defines how the driver acts.
#
# The drivers are activated by specifiying them in a driver= line in the
# server section, like:
#
#   Driver=curses
#
# This tells LCDd to use the curses driver. The first driver that is
# loaded and is capable of output becomes 'the' output driver.
# All extra drivers can only serve as input.
# The default driver to use is curses.
#
# The drivers can read their own options from the config file, but most of
# them don't do this yet. They expect 'command-line'-format parameters that
# were previously placed on the command line. These parameters can be
# given to the driver in the following way:
#
#   Arguments="place arguments here"
#
# The arguments between the quotes are passed to the driver.
# As said before these are the same arguments that the driver would have
# been passed under the old command line format of
#
#   -d <driver> "<driverargs>"
#
# Note that the -d option still works, but not allows driverargs anymore.
# If -d is specified on the command line, the Driver= options in the
# config file are ignored.


[server]
# Server section with all kinds of settings for the LCDd server

Driver=curses
#Driver=HD44780
#Driver=lcdm001
#Driver=MtxOrb
#
# Tells the server to load the given drivers. Multiple lines can be given.
# NOTE: You may activate several input (input only) drivers but only ONE output
#       driver, which should be the first.

Bind=127.0.0.1
# Tells the driver to bind to the given interface

Port=13666
# Listen on this specified port; defaults to 13666.

#ReportLevel=3
# Sets the reporting level; defaults to 2 (warnings and errors only).

ReportToSyslog=no
# Should we report to syslog instead of stderr ? Default: no

WaitTime=5
# Sets the default time in seconds to displays a screen.

User=nobody
# User to run as.  LCDd will drop its root priviledges,
# if any, and run as this user instead.

ServerScreen=no
# Enables the server screen also when other screens are active.

Foreground=yes
# The server will stay in the foreground if set to true.
# Otherwise the server will fork to background and report
# to syslog
