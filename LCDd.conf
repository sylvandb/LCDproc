# LCDd.conf
#
# This file contains the configuration for the LCDd server.
# 
# The format is ini-file-like. It is divided into sections that start at
# markers that look like [section]. Comments are all line-based comments,
# and are lines that start with '#' or ';'.
#
# The server has a 'central' section named [server]. Further each driver 
# has a section which defines how the driver acts.
#
# The drivers are activated by specifiying them in a driver= line in the
# server section, like:
#
#   Driver=curses
#
# This tells LCDd to use the curses driver. The first driver that is
# loaded and is capable of output becomes 'the' output driver.
# All extra drivers can only serve as input.
# The default driver to use is curses.
#
# The drivers can read their own options from the config file, but most of
# them don't do this yet. They expect 'command-line'-format parameters that
# were previously placed on the command line. These parameters can be
# given to the driver in the following way:
#
#   Arguments="place arguments here"
#
# The arguments between the quotes are passed to the driver.
# As said before these are the same arguments that the driver would have
# been passed under the old command line format of
#
#   -d <driver> "<driverargs>"
#
# Note that the -d option still works, but not allows driverargs anymore.
# If -d is specified on the command line, the Driver= options in the 
# config file are ignored.


[server]
# Server section with all kinds of settings for the LCDd server

Driver=curses
#Driver=HD44780
#Driver=MtxOrb
#
# Tells the server to load the given drivers. Multiple lines can be given.

Bind=127.0.0.1
# Tells the driver to bind to the given interface

Port=13666

#ServerScreen=no
# Enables the built-in server screen [Default: noscreen]
# yes      : always,
# noscreen : when there are no other screens active,
# no       : never, the LCD display will be blank when there are 
#            no screens active.

Foreground=yes
# The server will stay in the foreground if set to true.

DriverPath=server/drivers/
# Where can we find the driver modules ?
# Always place a slash as last character !
