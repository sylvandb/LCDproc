# LCDd.conf
#
# This file contains the configuration for the LCDd server.
# 
# The format is ini-file-like. It is divided into sections that start at
# markers that look like [section]. Comments are all line-based comments,
# and are lines that start with '#' or ';'.
#
# The server has a 'central' section named [server]. Further each driver 
# has a section which defines how the driver acts.
#
# The drivers are activated by specifiying them in a driver= line in the
# server section, like:
#
#   Driver=curses
#
# This tells LCDd to use the curses driver. The first driver that is
# loaded and is capable of output becomes 'the' output driver.
# All extra drivers can only serve as input.
# The default driver to use is curses.
#
# In the driver sections currently only one keyword is recognized:
#
#   Arguments="place arguments here"
#
# These are the arguments to be passed to the driver, without quotes.
# These are the same arguments that the driver would have been passed
# under the old command line format of
#
#   -d <driver> "<driverargs>"
#
# Note that the -d option still works, but not allows arguments anymore.
# If -d is specified on the command line, the Driver= options in the 
# config file are ignored.


[server]
# Server section with all kinds of settings for the LCDd server

Driver=curses
#Driver=HD44780
#Driver=MtxOrb
#
# Tells the server to load the given drivers. Multiple lines can be given.

Bind=127.0.0.1
# Tells the driver to bind to the given interface

Port=13666
# Listen on this specified port; defaults to 13666.

#Debug=5
# Sets the debugging level; defaults to 0 (no debugging output).

WaitTime=5
# Sets the default time in seconds to displays a screen.

User=nobody
# User to run as.  LCDd will drop its root priviledges,
# if any, and run as this user instead.

ServerScreen=no
# Enables the server screen also when other screens are active.

Foreground=yes
# The server will stay in the foreground if set to true.

Size=20x4
# Specifies the size of the LCD.
# In case of multiple combined displays, this should be the total size.

#vspan=1,2
# For multiple displays: at what 'logical' lines do the individual displays
# start. 

#extended=yes
# If you want to use more than 3 HD44780 controllers on the LPT, you need to 
# specify this. See documentation.

#DelayMult=2
# If your display is slow and cannot keep up with the flow of data from
# LCDd, garbage can appear on the LCDd. Set this delay factor to 2 or 4
# to increase the delays. Default: 1.

DelayBus=true
# You can reduce the inserted dalays by setting this to false.
# On fast PCs it is possible your LCD does not respond correctly.
# Default: true.
