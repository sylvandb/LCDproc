# LCDd.conf
#
# This file contains the configuration for the LCDd server.
# 
# The format is ini-file-like. It is divided into sections that start at
# markers that look like [section]. Comments are all line-based comments,
# and are lines that start with '#' or ';'.
#
# The server has a 'central' section named [server]. For the menu there is
# a section called [menu]. Further each driver has a section which
# defines how the driver acts.
#
# The drivers are activated by specifiying them in a driver= line in the
# server section, like:
#
#   Driver=curses
#
# This tells LCDd to use the curses driver.
# The first driver that is loaded and is capable of output defines the
# size of the display. The default driver to use is curses.
# If -d is specified on the command line, the Driver= options in the 
# config file are ignored.
#
# The drivers can read their own options from the config file, but some of
# them don't do this yet. They expect 'command-line'-format parameters that
# were previously placed on the command line. These parameters can be
# given to the driver in the following way:
#
#   Arguments="place arguments here"
#
# The arguments between the quotes are passed to the driver.
# As said before these are the same arguments that the driver would have
# been passed under the old command line format of
#
#   -d <driver> "<driverargs>"
#
# Note that the -d option still works, but not allows driverargs anymore.


[server]
# Server section with all kinds of settings for the LCDd server

Driver=curses
#Driver=hd44780
#Driver=MtxOrb
#Driver=CFontz633
#Driver=CwLnx
#
# Tells the server to load the given drivers. Multiple lines can be given.
# The name of the driver is exactly the same as the name of the driver
# module that is to be loaded, including the case of the letters !
# (That is: unless a file= option is given in the driver section)

Bind=127.0.0.1
# Tells the driver to bind to the given interface

Port=13666
# Listen on this specified port; defaults to 13666.

#ReportLevel=3
# Sets the reporting level; defaults to 2 (warnings and errors only).

#ReportToSyslog=yes
# Should we report to syslog instead of stderr ? Default: no

WaitTime=5
# Sets the default time in seconds to displays a screen.

User=nobody
# User to run as.  LCDd will drop its root priviledges,
# if any, and run as this user instead.

#ServerScreen=no
# If yes, the the serverscreen will be rotated as a usual info screen. If no,
# it will be a background screen, only visible when no other screens are
# active.

#Foreground=no
# The server will stay in the foreground if set to true.

DriverPath=server/drivers/
# Where can we find the driver modules ?
# Always place a slash as last character !

# The "...Key=" lines define what the server does with keypresses that
# don't go to any client.
# These are the defaults:
ToggleRotateKey=Enter
PrevScreenKey=Left
NextScreenKey=Right
#ScrollUpKey=Up
#ScrollDownKey=Down

# If you have only 4 keys, you can choose to use this:
#ToggleRotateKey=Enter
#PrevScreenKey=Up
#NextScreenKey=Down

# If you have only 3 keys, you can choose to use this:
#ToggleRotateKey=Enter
#PrevScreenKey=Up



[menu]
# The menu section. The menu is an internal LCDproc client.
# You can configure what keys the menu should use. Note that only the menukey
# will be reserved exclusively, the others in shared mode.

# The following works excelent with 4 keys or more.
MenuKey=Escape
EnterKey=Enter
UpKey=Up
DownKey=Down

# If you have only 3 keys, you could use something like this:
#MenuKey=Escape
#EnterKey=Enter
#DownKey=Down


# Driver sections are below this line, in alphabetical order
