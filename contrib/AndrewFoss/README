What do these patches do ?
==========================

1. HKEY - Hybrid Right/Left Key option in LCDd.conf

If selected, the same config works on 4 or 6 key pads, any key wakes up 
the menus, the keys behave a bit more intuitively and if you have a menu 
w/ only ring or slider you can't get stuck in them on a 4 key system. 
Ultimately, I wonder if the key processing could be simplified a bit, it 
currently has 3 levels, that might be able to be flattened, I've been 
pondering it and don't have a simple sol'n yet, but feel like there's 
one there, so I'll keep thinking on it for now.

2. OPT - adds options to the LCDd.conf for;
storing the default display string on the CFontz633.c, we use this to 
put up a "starting" message for reboot for example.
setting the main menu name - which show's up on the LCD menu list, we 
give it a more meaningful name like "admin" for the menus, instead of 
"lcdproc"
setting the goodbye msg - which we set to "shutting down", instead of 
"Thanks for using lcdproc+linux"

3. SEG - adds the ability to get a stack trace for the LCDd daemon. I 
didn't actually catch a useful trace w/ it, but might be a nice 
diagnostic ability or not worth the trouble, maybe gdb's just easier 
when you need?
