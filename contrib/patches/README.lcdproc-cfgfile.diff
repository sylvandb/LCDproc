Here's a patch for lcdproc to add a config file, as promised, it applies 
to the 20060226 version from CVS.

It covers the basics and get's the infrastructure to add more, like on 
the process size screen, we may want an option not to add up the sizes 
of each of the procs, since in a shared mem app, the answer is 
incorrectly large.

I realize in doing it that I'm not entirely clear on the purpose of "on 
time" "off time" and "show invisible" in the sequence structure, so 
they're now settable, but I could use some help putting more descriptive 
helpful text in the lcdproc.conf file to describe them for folks.

thanks,
andrew
