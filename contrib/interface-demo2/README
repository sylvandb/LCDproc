may be someone else will find our little testing setup also helpful ?!

i attached it to this mail (since it's just 28K though i didn't clean up the files ...)
and one can download it from
http://www.pyramid.de/e/produkte/server/pyramid-lcd.php#step_by_step
respectively
http://www.pyramid.de/d/downloads/demo_for_pylcd-lcdproc.tgz

AFAIK it will be quite easy to adapt it to other LCDs

HTH & keep up the good work

regards,
thomas
