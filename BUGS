Known Bugs:
--------------

v0.5.3
  - A client gets disconnected if it sends a many commands quickly. This can
    happen during initial screen setup or if vBars are used on large (40x4)
    displays.
  - If vBars are used together with ICON_BLOCK_FILLED on the same screen and
    that icon is implemented as a custom char, it sometimes is replaced with
    a non full block from the vBar.
  - On Solaris the mtc_s16209x driver fails to compile. Configure LCDproc to
    exclude this driver.
